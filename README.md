## Directory Structure

- **P1**: Practical 1
- **P2**: Practical 2
- **P3**: Practical 3
- **P4**: Practical 4
- **P5**: Practical 5
- **P6**: Practical 6
- **P7**: Practical 7 - Autoencoders (CNN & LSTM) with Streamlit App
- **cia**: Continuous Internal Assessment related files

## Getting Started

Navigate to each directory to find specific notebooks and scripts for that practical.
For P7, you can run the Streamlit app using:
